                <p> Pompompurin is a good-natured Golden Retriever dog character introduced by the Japanese company Sanrio in 1996. Purin was born on a sunny day on April 16th. Pompompurin lives in his own basket in the entrance hall of his sister-owner's house.
                     His trademark is his brown beret that is always on top of his head. Pompompurin's favorite food is his mama's pudding.</p>
